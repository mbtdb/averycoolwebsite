                    <h1>welcome.</h1>
                    <p>this is my personal website.</p>
                    <p>Also, this is the small window to my massive backend services that run on this domain lol</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>i use it as a place to collect things i care about &#8212; notes,
ideas, screenshots, projects, and whatever else doesn&rsquo;t really fit anywhere else.</p>
                    <p>i&rsquo;m not trying to make it polished or complete. I know, i&apos;ve used tons of assets from others, but it&apos;s temporary, as I will slowly build this site up</p>

                    <h2>what you’ll find here</h2>
                    <p>
some pages are more technical, some are more personal, and some are just collections of things
i didn’t want to lose. there isn’t a strict structure, and that’s intentional.</p>
                    <p>
i’m more interested in having a space i control than building something that looks impressive.
if something feels unfinished, it probably is — and that’s fine.</p>

                    <h2>about this site</h2>
                    <p>
most of this is written and edited by hand. things will change, break, and get rewritten over
time. older versions might disappear. new sections might show up without explanation.</p>
                    <p>
i like older personal websites because they felt quieter and more deliberate. this is my
attempt at keeping that spirit alive.</p>
