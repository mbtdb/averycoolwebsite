                    <h1>welcome.</h1>
                    This website is a small part, to a massive backend of homelab/server services.
                    <p>
this is my personal website. i use it as a place to collect things i care about — notes,
ideas, screenshots, projects, and whatever else doesn’t really fit anywhere else.</p>
                    <p>
i’m not trying to make it polished or complete. i like to experiment on things and changing
them as i go. this site is part archive, part workspace, and part experiment.</p>

                    <h2>what you’ll find here</h2>
                    <p>
some pages are more technical, some are more personal, and some are just collections of things
i didn’t want to lose. there isn’t a strict structure, and that’s intentional.</p>

                    <h2>about this site</h2>
                    <p>
most of this is written and edited by hand. things will change, break, and get rewritten over
time. older versions might disappear. new sections might show up without explanation.</p>
